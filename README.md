# HospitalDB
This project is from an already graded school assesmment which assesses student's knowledge of SQL. 
The assesment requires one to imagine themself as a database developer consultant for a hospital, who are currently in the process of developing a new database system which they require for storing information taking into consideration the client's requirements.
