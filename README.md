# HospitalDB
This project is from an already graded school assessment which assesses student's knowledge of SQL. 
The assessment requires one to imagine themselves as a database developer consultant for a hospital, that is currently developing a new database system which they need for storing information and considering the client's requirements.

This project was written using Microsoft Transact SQL.
